Create a program that ask user for a question, it will also ask for 4 possible answer (a,b,c,d) and the correct answer. Write the collected data to a text file. Ask another question until the user chose to exit.
thanks to the previous practice programs i learned about string manipulations and loops, so i applied it to my code. So it is important that you will learn and apply it always.
I CREATED THE QUIZ EXECUTOR THAT READS THE FILE FROM QUIZ CREATOR

EDIT: i delayed my work because i was struggling on how to do i, i researched bunch of things and reviewed my previous works, so i applied it on my my curretn code now, as i already created my code i was satisfied because i managed to do it, made a workin gprogram that has it's functionality, but in the end i struggle in order to learn, we always learn through hard way.

another edit: i did not used the per answers is per lines, instead i used a one liner and made the correct answer is inside the () so i did that to challenged myself instead of changing my previous code. :D
FOR EXAMPLE:

Not: Which is correct?
    yes
    yes
    no
I did: Which is correct? yes, yes, yes, no (no)
